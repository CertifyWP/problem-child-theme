# CertifyWP: Problem Child Theme

This is a sample theme to be downloaded, installed, and activated on your WordPress site as part of your CertifyWP credential program. 

When active, this looks exactly like the default twentytwentythree theme but with a red background. 

## Troubleshooting
You should see a grey bar at the bottom of every page that says "CertifyWP Problem Child is working!"

If you don't see this, you will need to look at the code to figure out why.
